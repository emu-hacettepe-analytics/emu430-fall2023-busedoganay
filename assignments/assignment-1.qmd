# Assignment 1

```{r}
1 + 1
```

My first assignment has two parts.

## (a) Summary

I choose RStudio Global 2022 Conference Talks and watched Developing Internal Tools for Multi-Lingual Teams. He gives examples about this subject using R and Python in Bumble application.

## 

## (b) What strategies can we use to make developing tool simultaneously with Python and R easier?

Idea #1 Building identical generic functions

print()

summary()

broom::tidy()

in R

say_hello \<- function(x) {

UseMethod("say_hello")

}

say_hello.data.frame \<- function(x) {

print("Hello dataframe!")

}

say_hello.default \<- function(x) {

print("Hello there!")

}

in Python

def say_hello(x)

return"Hello there!"

Idea #2 Identical error handling with classes

in Python

try:

#some code goes here

except FileNotFoundError:

#code to handle FileNotFoundError

in R

stop("This throws an error!")

#\> Error: This throws an error

rlang::abort("This throws an error!")

#\> Error:

#\>! This throws an error!

Idea #3 Creating your own internal wrappers

Calling Python from R
